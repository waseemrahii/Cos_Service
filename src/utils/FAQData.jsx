            question: "What is Partial status?",
            answer: "Partial Status is when we partially refund the remains of an order. Sometimes for some reasons we are unable to deliver a full order, so we refund you the remaining undelivered amount. Example: You bought an order with quantity 10,000 and charges $10, let's say we delivered 9,000 and the remaining 1,000 we couldn't deliver, then we will 'Partial' the order and refund you the remaining 1,000 ($1 in this example)."

            question: "What is Drip Feed?",
            answer: "Drip Feed is a service that we are offering so you would be able to put the same order multiple times automatically. Example: let's say you want to get 1,000 likes on your Instagram Post but you want to get 100 likes each 30 minutes, you will put Link: Your Post Link Quantity: 100 Runs: 10 (as you want to run this order 10 times, if you want to get 2,000 likes, you will run it 20 times, etc.) Interval: 30 (because you want to get 100 likes on your post each 30 minutes, if you want each hour, you will put 60 because the time is in minutes). P.S: Never order more quantity than the maximum which is written on the service name (Quantity x Runs)."

            question: "How to get a YouTube comment link?",
            answer: "Find the timestamp that is located next to your username above your comment (for example: '3 days ago') and hover over it then right click and 'Copy Link Address'. The link will be something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12345&lc=a1b21etc instead of just https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12345. To be sure that you got the correct link, paste it in your browser's address bar and you will see that the comment is now the first one below the video and it says 'Highlighted comment'."
